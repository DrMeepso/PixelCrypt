# PixelCrypt

This repo contains a script that can hide base64 characters in an image. The script can also decode an image that was encoded using the script. it dose this by using a offset average value to represent the character.

All code for encodeing and decodeing is in the `src/ashCode.ts` file.

## How to use it

To use the script you can open the /docs folder as it contains the compiled static files. You can also run the script yourself by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npx vite` to start the development server.
4. Open the link provided by the development server in your browser.
5. Drag and drop an image file onto the page. And encode or decode the image.
